------From Allison - sorry its so long! 
//// Heres my concert "reviews". Variations of local artists from the towns along with big names with "shows" that were "played" in the town we had to have. Troy and I also chose to use  pen names for the blog posts.////

Maroon 5 concert:

    Maroon 5 put on an amazing show! They played some of their biggest hits spanning the last 20 years. There were almost 20,000 people in attendance. A totally sold out show! It was an event of a lifetime! Highly recommend! Grab your girlfriends and head on out for a girl's night when they come to town next year!

NC local band review: Parmalee

    This concert was a blast! Took my entire family to see NC locals "Parmalee" in Charlotte, NC, and we all had one heck of a good time that night! Super family friendly event. We got to meet the band and have our picture taken with them. The kids received guitar picks from the band as souvenirs. This group is great and really responded well to their fanbase.

Plain White T's Concert:

    Plain White T's hit the stage in this small town concert venue in Charlotte, NC with about 8,000 people in attendance. What a fun show they put on! They played many hits from their years in the business and some new music they have made. My favorite part was ending the night with their biggest hit ever, "Hey there Delilah"! I cannot wait to have another chance to hear them play!

"Friends" Bar Show:

    Raspy voice singers, from the Charlotte area, who go by the name "Friends" played a small town bar gig this past weekend. The event itself was hosted by our small business and was a blast as these "friends" sang some original songs and took some requests from the party-goers. They played until the wee hours of the morning and kept the party vibes high. They were a super band to have play this event and we will have them again!

DaBaby Bank of America Show:

    Rapper "DaBaby" rocks at Bank of America stadium in Charlotte, NC. As a local to NC, right outside of Charlotte, DaBaby has built a huge fanbase in the area. While he's not my cup of tea my teen was a big fan of the show. Personal favorite part was when Dua Lipa came out to do a duet with him. The show was geared more towards a younger audience but a fun time was still had.

Michael W Smith Church Tour:

    Michael W. Smith Christian singer/song writer played at our Charlotte church last evening as part of our Christian Music Series. This was the final tour on his 2021 stop and our final show for the year. We hosted a family friendly event and Smith was a great addition. We are happy to have ended with this artist. His music was enjoyed by all of those in attendance and the messages left with us were very moving.

//// End of Charlotte- Asheville begins////

    West King String Band review:

    Asheville locals venture outside of their home town to perform a party show in a smaller NC town. This private, birthday booking was the flair that this party needed. They had a nice twang about them. They had their own set list but also took requests from the part guests. They had quite the crowd dancing as they played for hours on end! This is definitely a party that will be talked about for a long time to come thanks to this string band! West King String band brought such a fun vibe with them!

    Luke Combs:

    Asheville native Luke Combs returns to Asheville and brings the party with him. This tour stop, geared towards college aged fans, was a party! People tailgated for hours while they waited for this show to begin. He sang hits such as "Hurricane" and "When It Rains It Pours". Finished up the night with his most recent hit and the arena was buzzing! You can always expect Luke to bring the party!

    Chase Rice:

    Last night at Asheville fair ROCKED! The performance from Chase Rice was amazing! I loved the song line up and the tossing of guitar picks from the stage! He played hard and put on the best show I've seen all year. I hope to find next year's line up to be just as exciting and fresh!

The Rolling Stones:

    Got super lucky and saw The Rolling Stones in concert in Asheville, NC this past week! What an amazing show but do we expect anything less from Jagger? Asheville was super lucky to have the Stones with us in our town! I hope to see them in concert again soon! BEST. NIGHT. EVER.
